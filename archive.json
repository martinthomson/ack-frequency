Allowing the sender to alter the client behavior mid-connection would be beneficial, as that would allow the sender reduce the ACK rate when it disables packet number-based loss detection.\r\n\r\nLet's assume here that peers might adjust their reordering threshold based on the amount of reordering they're seeing, i.e. that they will increase it from the default value of 3 to a higher value if they detect a lot of spurious retransmissions when using 3.\r\nIn that case, would it maybe make sense to define a threshold when to send an ACK for a reordered packet? For example, let's say packet N is missing, but N+1 is received. If you're using a high reordering threshold, you wouldn't care to receive an ACK for this event immediately. However, you'd still care to get an ACK when N+10 is received, because in that case your packet number-based loss detection will be able to quickly repair the loss of packet N.\r\n",

I'm not convinced that it'll get all that used, but if the receiver behavior is not much more complicated to implement, then I'm ok with specifying that.\r\n\r\nSo, here's a shot at defining receiver behavior. A receiver has to measure the degree of reordering and then decide whether to ack immediately or not.  This degree of reordering can be defined as follows: the distance of the received packet from the largest_received (for that PN space). Basically:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (PN > LR):\r\n    if (PN - LR >= max_reordering): send immediate ack\r\nelse:\r\n    if (LR - PN >= max_reordering): send immediate ack\r\n```\r\n\r\nA couple of examples to see if this works out. Let's say LR is the largest_received packet number.\r\n\r\nA reordering distance of 2 means that LR+2 and larger or LR-2 and smaller will trigger an immediate ack. This seems ok. All distances greater than 2 also seem ok.\r\n\r\nReordering distance of 1 is a bit tricky. This distance means that if LR+1 is received, that triggers an immediate ack. Similarly, anything smaller than or equal to LR-1 will also trigger immediate ack (anything smaller than the largest received). The current reordering recommendation in the transport draft will have the receiver acking immediately on receiving LR-1, and we should be able to cover that case, so we should be able to express this value.\r\n\r\nBut this is a bit wonky, since LR+1 is basically the next expected, and this reordering value effectively turns into `ack every packet`. It would be nice to avoid this problem. We can do that by using Ian's suggestion of special casing the value 1: \"any reordering, as defined as a PN that does not increase the LR by 1, will trigger an ack.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, special casing the value 0 for disable immediate acking on reordering is useful.\r\n\r\nHaving worked through this, it doesn't seem that terrible. I'm ok with varint or single byte. I agree with @ianswett that the most usefulness will be in 1 byte, but I can see the value in leaving it open and uniform.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

          "body": "@janaiyengar, thank you for picking up my suggestion and writing the pseudo code.\r\nI'm not sure if just looking at the largest received is sufficient to properly cover all cases. Assume you receive packet `N`, packet `N+2`. At this point `LR = N+2`. Now you receive `N + max_reordering`. I would have assumed that it makes sense now to send an immediate ACK to help with the recovery of `N+1`, however, the algorithm doesn't capture that case.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I was wondering about the negative branch (where `PN < LR`). This branch can only be taken if we sent an ACK earlier for exceeding the `max_reordering`. Assuming that ACK was received, the packet in question would already have been declared lost, so in that case sending an immediate ACK wouldn't make any difference. Is my understanding correct that the negative branch exists for the case in which the original ACK was lost?\r\n\r\nEncoding-wise, we might be able to simplify things a bit replacing `max_reordering` by `max_gap` (where a `max_gap` of 1 would be a `max_reordering` of 2). Then we could avoid special-casing the value of 1.\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering how many immediate ACKs you're supposed to send. Currently, the draft has some quite complicated conditions for this:\r\n> an endpoint SHOULD send an ACK frame immediately on receiving an ack-eliciting packet that is out of order. The endpoint MAY continue sending ACK frames immediately on each subsequently received packet, but the endpoint SHOULD return to acknowledging every other packet within a period of 1/8 x RTT, unless more ack-eliciting packets are received out of order.\r\n\r\nDo we need some similar advice here? Or do we need to make it configurable?\r\n",

If they're using this reordering tolerant setting, it seems likely they're tolerant to more reordering than a typical sender.  For example, it could be because they have adaptive packet threshold loss detection and the threshold has been increased substantially due to observing past reordering.",

It seems more appealing, but I think it depends on the use case.\r\n\r\nI'm also concerned it adds non-trivial implementation complexity.  Implementations already have a max_ack_delay and a number of packets before sending an immediate ACK, so this is just adding a mechanism to change those thresholds during the connection.  However, this reordering feature may end up substantially changing the code to send ACKs.  I'd be pretty sad if a bunch of implementations didn't implement the draft because they didn't want to deal with the extra complexity.",

For example, if the remembered value of MAX_STREAMS is 0 and the newly received value is 4, an endpoint is forbidden to open _any_ stream in 0-RTT even _after_ receiving the transport parameters. It is only when you switch to using 1-RTT packets that the newly received transport parameter is applied.\r\n\r\nFor your implementation, wouldn't it be possible to use the same latch for ack_frequency?",

In general that's a good idea, but not for the 2 RTT of the connection. Once the client obtains the 1RTT key, it will start receiving data sent by the server in \"false start\". At that point the client has assessed the RTT of the connection, but the server has not. The \"max ack delay\" sent by the server is a guess based on statistics. It will typically be longer than recommended values like RTT/4. The effect is that the first ACKs are sent too late, which  has a cascading effect with some congestion control algorithms.\r\n\r\nMy fix was to use the values locally computed by the client until the session is confirmed and the server can send accurate \"ack frequency\" frames. Not sure whether we should have text about that in the draft.",

In order for this to not delay loss detection in some cases, the ack_delay field needs to be no larger than the time threshold for loss detection, which could be a limitation depending upon min_ack_delay, but I would typically expect to be fine.\r\n\r\nThe field could also be used for other use cases where packets aren't always sent in order, but that doesn't need to be explained in this draft.\r\n\r\nFor implementation, on every ack-eliciting packet:\r\n- If it's smaller than the largest acked in the last sent ack frame, send an immediate ACK because it fills a hole.\r\n- If it's larger than the last sent largest acked, only send an immediate ACK if there are missing packets greater than the last sent largest acked that are at least packet_threshold away from the current largest received packet.\r\n\r\nThis speeds up loss detection very slightly vs the core transport draft if the packet reordering threshold isn't an odd number, because the ACK is sent exactly when the sender will be able to use it to declare a loss.",

I struggled to understand this proposal, because the way it is framed is confusing.  I believe that there is a much simpler way of describing and implementing this than is in the current draft (and the proposed change).\r\n\r\nThe current strategy has you immediately ACK for any Initial or Handshake packet, or any packet numbered lower than the largest acknowledged.  (You might also add a packet containing PING, which is reasonable.)  The draft should put those universal conditions for an immediate ACK in a separate section.  Right now, this is not very clear in the text.\r\n\r\nThen there are those packets that arrive after largest acknowledged.  The draft before this change covers packets that arrive perfectly in sequence.  For those, there are a certain number that arrive that don't get acknowledged.  If you get more than that, then you acknowledge immediately.  This is currently phrased differently, in that you acknowledge when you receive N.  \r\n\r\nThis issue proposes to cover the case where the packets you receive after largest acknowledged are NOT contiguous.  Phrased in that way, the number is the same as the packet threshold, but it only applies after there is a gap detected.\r\n\r\nThat leaves you with:\r\n\r\n![Immediate ACK conditions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67641/89747912-38f2a680-db04-11ea-9d7d-430556a8933a.png)\r\n\r\nThat is, there is a window in which packets can arrive without generating an immediate acknowledgment.  I've found that thinking in those terms simplifies this a lot.\r\n\r\nWith this picture in mind, the special 0 value that Ian's pull request uses to disable the loss threshold isn't necessary.  You can disable the special loss threshold by setting that value to be the same as the packet threshold.  You might have to prohibit the loss threshold from exceeding the packet threshold just to avoid silly conditions where a gap causes more delays, but the receiver could just clamp the value.\r\n\r\nI am going to suggest that this be changed to the number of unacknowledged, contiguous packets so that you can remove 0 as an invalid value.  That is, of course, orthogonal; you can always add one, but you can see that this is not necessary.  As you can see from the diagram, if you want an immediate ACK always, it is easier to think of the window being 0 width than it is to think about the packet that you received.\r\n\r\nBTW, you can also think about the time component in the same way: there is a period of time during which you don't generate an immediate acknowledgment.  That isn't perfect, because you start that period when the first packet arrives, but it's not a *bad* fit.",

          "body": "@martinthomson I think that _almost_ works, but I am not sure if it's sufficient. It seems that the approach does not handle reordered packets that carry packet numbers below largest acked, and I think that might be a problem.\r\n\r\nLet's consider the following example. There are two paths from the server, with a difference of 10ms. The server sends a packet every millisecond. Odd-numbered packets are transferred on the faster path, even-numbered ones on the slower path. \"Packet Tolerance\" is set to 25 packets (1/8th of RTT).\r\n\r\n```\r\n   +------ 100ms ------+\r\n   v                   |\r\nserver --> 100ms --> client\r\n       --> 110ms -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client will receive packets in the order of something like: 11, 2, 13, 4, 15, 6, 17, 8, 19, 10, 21, 12, 23, 14, 25, 16, 27, 18, 29, 20 ...\r\n\r\nWhat we want to achieve is:\r\n* When the reordering threshold is small (e.g., 5), this pattern should elicit one ack every 2 packets.\r\n* When the reordering threshold is above the reorder (e.g., 12), this pattern should elicit one ack every 25 packets.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the algorithm proposed in https://github.com/janaiyengar/ack-frequency/issues/35#issuecomment-671265305. Let's say that the client has sent an ack when it received 15. It will then go on to send acks when it receives packet 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, because the received packet number is below largest acked.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the proposed approach will emit 6 acks per 35 incoming packets, whereas what we want to see is 1 ack per 25 incoming packets.",

          "body": "So I worked through that and concluded that in cases of severe reordering you do get a burst of acknowledgments.  And if you have consistent reordering that happens a lot.\r\n\r\nIn your case, at least at the beginning, you will accumulate packets up to some number before you hit the reordering threshold and send an immediate ACK.  A reordering threshold less than 10 results in an ACK for every packet, but that's the intent, is it not?\r\n\r\nAs for the 6, 10, 10, 12, 14 being immediately acknowledged, this is based on this text in Ian's proposed resolution to this issue:\r\n\r\n> [...], implementations MUST still immediately acknowledge any received packets with packet numbers smaller than the largest 'Largest Acked' value previously sent in an ACK frame.\r\n\r\nI just accepted this premise as valid, but I see that it might not be.  In this example, it doesn't matter what is acknowledged, the next packet (and every other) will result in an immediate ACK.\r\n\r\nAnother scenario, perhaps a more realistic scenario one, is the one where a single packet (a small packet at the tail of a sequence of larger packets) is significantly reordered.  If you have 40 packets in flight and the last one jumps ahead of 23 of them, then this algorithm might be OK or it might not.  If it sees that packet 40 is preceded by 23 gaps, and it has acknowledged something past packet 15, then it will let the gap fill in if the loss threshold is 22 or 23.  If it acknowledged anything less than 15, it will immediately acknowledge 40 and then generate an immediate ACK for every packet that arrives as the gap is filled.  The huge variation between those cases is a little worrying.\r\n\r\nIf instead we count unacknowledged, ack-eliciting packets then we get something different.  You count each arriving ack-eliciting packet toward both thresholds if (? algorithm), but only toward the packet threshold if there is not.  We don't care about the largest acknowledged, just newly arriving packets.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm that I might use for that might look like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# def on_received(pn):\r\nexpected = ranges.largest.largest + 1\r\nranges.add(pn) # Track receipt.\r\n\r\n# Assuming that the packet was ack-eliciting...\r\nif space != ApplicationData:\r\n    immediate_ack = true\r\nelse:\r\n    out_of_order ||= pn != expected:\r\n    unacknowledged += 1\r\n    if out_of_order:\r\n        immediate_ack = unacknowledged > loss_threshold\r\n    else:\r\n        immediate_ack = unacknowledged > packet_threshold\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't consider the largest acknowledged at all.\r\n\r\nDoes that sound better?",

          "body": "@martinthomson Thank you for the response.\r\n\r\nI think it might be better to take a step back and discuss what we want to achieve, before discussing how things can be implemented.\r\n\r\n> In your case, at least at the beginning, you will accumulate packets up to some number before you hit the reordering threshold and send an immediate ACK. A reordering threshold less than 10 results in an ACK for every packet, but that's the intent, is it not?\r\n\r\nWe do not expect to see that. In our case (sending HTTP responses from different nodes within a server cluster), we would know when we would start sending from multiple nodes, and when we would stop doing so. Therefore, we can increase reordering threshold when we are about to enter that mode, reduce the threshold when we exit.\r\n\r\nConsider the case of sending two incremental responses from two nodes. Assuming that the prioritization logic would designate different QUIC streams for every packetiztaition opportunity, we will see the pattern that I used as the example; half of the packets (e.g., odd-numbered) sent from one cluster node arrive earlier (or later) than those sent from the other.\r\n\r\n> Another scenario, perhaps a more realistic scenario one, is the one where a single packet (a small packet at the tail of a sequence of larger packets) is significantly reordered.\r\n\r\nWe expect to see this pattern, when the coordinator node within the cluster sends ACKs, while all the ack-eliciting packets are sent by a different node.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the draft has `ignore_order` bit, and it covers these use-cases fairly well. For us, setting the ignore bit and relying on packet threshold (which would be set to 1/8th of CWND) would work fine.\r\n\r\nAs stated in [my earlier comment](https://github.com/janaiyengar/ack-frequency/issues/35#issuecomment-617459893), my strong desire is that the switch from a boolean to an integer, assuming that would happen, would not cause regression regarding these use-cases.",

You need to make sure that this doesn't force the receiver to ACK every CE-marked ACK, which could lead to interminable ACK ping-pong.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the sender should be slowing down, so perhaps it's not so bad to ram the reverse path full of ACKs under 100% congestion in the forward path. But it's not necessary - you could potentially squash other traffic sharing the reverse path. Particularly not nice in the first RTT before the sender starts responding. \r\n\r\nInstead, a requirement like under the [AccECN link](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-accurate-ecn#section-3.2.2.5.1) that Mirja pointed to, where you ACK every 'n' CE marks in a row will be sufficient. And if the peers support ACK frequency control, you might want to say 'n' is the greater of a) whatever 'standard' value is set by the IETF and b) the current ACK frequency requested by the sender.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that the AccECN section linked above was massively changed between -14 (when Mirja pointed to it) and -15 (now).

Section 13.2.1 of RFC 9000 does say that ACKs should be sent immediately if:\r\n\r\n\"In order to assist loss detection at the sender, an endpoint SHOULD generate and send an ACK frame without delay when it receives an ack-eliciting packet either:\r\n\r\n- when the received packet has a packet number less than another ack-eliciting packet that has been received, or\r\n\r\n- when the packet has a packet number larger than the highest-numbered ack-eliciting packet that has been received and there are missing packets between that packet and this packet.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the first bullet clearly is reordering, the second could be caused by three different mechanisms: Reordering of packets, loss of packets, or sender intentional gap (as discussed in #34)\r\nThus, I think this section needs to be clear if actually means both of the above bullets for when to send ACK or only one of them? \r\n",

I like the new text you propose (I've proposed some changes), but I think you might be assuming that ACK_FREQUENCY is only used for delaying acks further. An important point that bears bringing out in the motivation is that a sender might want more frequent acks as well, for example during startup. That's worth capturing in the modified motivation section.",

Typically, the number of blocks will exceed an internal threshold and trigger an ack before the attack being described here becomes an issue. I would be fine with pointing that out explicitly, and that would work as a mitigation.",

I tried implementing this and realized that if you hold ranges of packets, you can do something sensible without having to limit the value of `loss_threshold`, but it isn't very easy to think about.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't sent an ACK yet, then you can check that the `range.min > 0` and `range.max > loss_threshold`.  This says that the range of unacknowledged packets you have received doesn't start at 0 and there might be more than `loss_threshold` packets outstanding.  This bit gets a little sketchy when people start packet numbers at numbers greater than 0, but I think that the immediate ACK there is tolerable in that case, because it happens just once when it might not be desirable (that is, for the first application data packet).\r\n\r\nIf you have sent an ACK including `largest`, then you check that `range.min > largest + 1` and `range.max > largest + loss_threshold`.\r\n\r\nThis only works if you merge ranges properly when receiving packets.  For instance, when receiving packets 3, 1, and 2 in that order, you produce a single range that covers 1 to 3 and not separate ranges.  Merging ranges is fairly straightforward, and you more or less have to it to construct valid ACK frames, but it's worth noting.\r\n\r\nI ultimately track the *next* packet that needs acknowledgment rather than the largest (this saves errors at 0), and so I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\non_received(pn):\r\n\r\nranges.add(pn)\r\nif pn == ranges.largest().max {\r\n  # this just extended the most recent range\r\n  last_packet_time = now()\r\n  if loss_threshold > 0:\r\n    reordered = next_unacknowledged < ranges.largest().min && pn >= next_unacknowledged + loss_threshold\r\n  else:\r\n    reordered = false\r\nelse:\r\n  reordered = pn < next_unacknowledged\r\nendif\r\n```",

              "body": "I think the original attempt to emulate Accurate ECN feedback in TCP might have been misguided. The AccECN machinery was necessary in TCP because TCP does _not_ have ACK frequency control. Here in QUIC we are adding ACK frequency control. So the only addition needed for ECN should indeed be to immediately trigger an ACK on a transition from non-CE to CE marking. Then, QUIC should just continue ACKing every Ack-Eliciting Threshold packets. No need for the max(2, ...). I think (I'm not working on QUIC, so I don't keep the whole of the QUIC design in my working memory).\r\n\r\nThat sorts out the lower bound on ACK frequency, but it leaves one problem at the upper bound (if I understand QUIC correctly). [RFC9000 \u00a713.2.1.  Sending ACK Frames](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-13.2.1) and [\u00a713.2.4. Limiting Ranges by Tracking ACK Frames](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-13.2.4) suggest that a host that is only sending non-ack-eliciting packets could occasionally include an ack-eliciting packet (e.g. a ping) to catch up on the feedback and allow the other end to clear out the state its been collecting.\r\n\r\nAn example where this could be a problem is when data transfer switches back and forth from one QUIC peer to the other. Imagine an asymmetric data transfer from A to B ends. If the network CE-marked many or all the ACKs on the reverse path (B-A), I believe A will not ACK any of the last round of ACKs it receives. Then if B becomes the sender of a volley of data, it will unknowingly send data into a path that was already congested just with ACKs.\r\n\r\nWith ECN, I'm not sure it's the best design to rely on the sender of the non-ack-eliciting packets (B in the example) to send an occasional ack-eliciting packet. If the receiver of the non-ack-eliciting packets (A) is seeing a large amount of ECN marks, it ought to be able to send occasional ACKs of non-ack-eliciting packets (to B), whether or not B asks for them.\r\n\r\nIn AccECN, we allowed TCP to ack a sequence of CE-marked ACKs, as long as the ACK frequency was no less than 1 per 3 CE-marked packets. Even with 100% CE-marking, this damps any potential ACK ping-pong but still ensures the other end receive feedback of congestion events.\r\n",
